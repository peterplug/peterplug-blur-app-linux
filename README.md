If FFmpeg isnt installed, make sure to install it (this will vary based on your distro so make sure to check how to do it on yours, I'm using Linux Mint for an example).

If you didn't have FFmpeg installed you might have to restart your pc.

After all the steps are done correctly you can finally add motion blur to your videos!
